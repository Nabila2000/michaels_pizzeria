    <h1> Michael's Pizzeria </h1>
  </header>
  <p class="ptag">Established in 1975 by Michael Pozzuoli, who is originally from Naples, Italy, the birthplace of pizza, Michael's Pizza is a "Greenwich Village institution" offereing the classic New York slice for over 37 years. First, we served our customers from our corner location at Bleecker and Carmine Street and now three doors down at 7 Carmine Street. At 75 years of age, Michael Pozzuoli still owns and operates the restaurant.</p>
  <p class="ptag">Michael's Pizza is a perennial top 10 listing in restaurant guides and publications such as Time Out New York and New York Magazine. NEW YORK MAGAZINE named Michael's Pizza "Best of New York" and in subsequent reviews referred to us as "the quintessentiall New York slice." In 2009 GQ Magazine listed Michael's Pizza as one the "Best 25 Pizzas on Earth." </p>
  
  <p class="ptag">Throughtout the years Michael's Pizza in Greenwich village has become just as popular with visitors and tourists as it is with native new Yorkers who know where to come for an authentic New York street slice.</p>
  <p class="ptag">After 38 years, Michael's is still an independently owned business at only one location, personally supervised by founder Michael himself. We still sre what we've always been: a classic NY slice joint. No glossy corporate backing, no fancy pants pien, no pretentious nonsense and go gimmcky budget pizza either. We are tried and true - the real deal.</p>
